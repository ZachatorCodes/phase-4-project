# BunkTrails

BunkTrails is a web application that can be used to store information about specific outdoor use trails, as well as associated reviews of those trails. Trails and reviews can only be created by registered users, and each user can only review each trail once.

This repository contains both the frontend and backend code required to get the application running.

BunkTrails is built using Ruby 3.2.2, Rails 7.0.8, and React 8.2.0, as well as using the BCrypt gem (3.1) and the React Router npm package (6.16.0).

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
